#### The Baton Pass: Data Onboarding and Offboarding

*August 27, 2025 11 AM - 1 PM*

This training will focus on the best practices for onboarding and offboarding data in research projects. We will cover how to document data sources, ensure reproducibility, and maintain data integrity throughout the project lifecycle. We will go over a template for creating an onboarding document and an offboarding checklist that is specific to those of us who deal with biological data.

### The Baton Pass: preparing your data for the hand-off TWO PART SERIES

**Part 1 April 21, 1 - 2 PM in person in Northwest Building 453**

**Part 2 April 28, 1 - 2 PM in person in Northwest Building 425**

In this two part hands-on workshop, we will provide you with the tools and procedures to make your research data self-documenting, saving yourself and future colleagues the headache of retracing your steps. In the first session, we will go over a template for creating an onboarding document and an offboarding checklist that is specific to those of us who deal with biological data. In the second session, we will look at a real example use case for these documents and also provide one-on-one assistance with filling out your own. By the end of this workshop, students will be able to identify key institutional knowledge they need to pass on and will come away with a ready to use documentation workflow that works for them. 

### Dataverse step-by-step for biology: how to archive & publish your data

**May 12, 1 - 3 PM in person in Northwest Building 453**

In this seminar + Q&A, guest speaker Katie Mika (MLS, Data Services Librarian) will be presenting a step-by-step guide for archiving & publishing your biological data in the Harvard Dataverse. Harvard Dataverse is a generalist repository for any kind of research data, big or small.

## :pizza: Programming and Pizza :pizza:
**April 9th 4 PM - 6 PM Northwest Building B227.45**

New for this month, we are going to start having extended office hours hangouts every second Wednesday of the month with free pizza! Come hang out and work on your code or data analysis while eating pizza! Meet w/other folks who also code, ask our expert bioinformaticians for advice, or solve a programming puzzle for practice!

Our first one is on April 9th! Come chat, work, and hang out! Register above!

### 1 hour seminars

We will be offering three 1-hour seminars on Wednesdays in March. *All seminars will be hybrid on zoom and in person in the Northwest Building meeting room B253*

**March 5 11AM-12PM - Introduction to Genome Annotation** 

The seminar will consist of a broad overview of what genome annotation is, an explanation of the various approaches and how they differ, and discussion of what metrics one should consider using to evaluate genome annotation quality. Students will learn how to pick the right tool for annotation and how to evaluate the product of that tool.

**March 12 11AM-12PM - Introduction to scRNA analysis**

This seminar provides a gentle introduction to the motivations for scRNAseq, the current technologies available from to design your single-cell experiment, the distinct data processing challenges that scRNAseq presents (compared to bulk RNAseq), and basic data processing and analysis steps that are the foundation for performing downstream analyses aimed at generating deeper biological insights.

**March 26 11AM-12PM - Installing & Managing software (Conda, Containers)** 

This seminar is intended for people who use (or may use) command line softwares and programs and assumes basic command line knowledge. We will learn about why software management is challenging, how to create and share conda environments, and how to use docker/singularity containers. We will be using the command line on the Cannon cluster, but these concepts can be translated to working on your local computer as well.
