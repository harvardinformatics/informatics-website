    "## Python terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented language, which means everything in python is an **object**, even numbers and strings. Objects have **attributes** and **methods** (functions) and are created from **classes**. When we use the equals sign `=`, we assign objects to **variables**. The variable name then becomes a way for us to refer to that object and we can access that object's attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object attributes and methods are accessed by using `.` after the variable name followed by the method or attribute name. **Classes** are like blueprints for an object, so when we say something is from X class, you can automatically know it should have certain attributes and methods. For example, any object of the `str` class should have the `upper()` method that converts every character to uppercase. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we may use both \"object\" and \"variable\" in similar ways, but they mean different things. If there is any confusion, please don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Here is a list of terminology for you to refer to. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Definition |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Object | The thing itself (an instance of a class) |\n",

    "When we collect data, we tend to think of them as categorical, numerical, ordinal, etc, and the specific type of data influences how we deal with them in our downstream analysis. Similarly, in computer science and in python, we need to distinguish between different data types because the functions we use to manipulate them will depend on the data we have. The basic data types are numerical, string, and boolean. In python, you can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data are data represented by a number. Numerical data can further be divided into integers `int` and floats `float`. There's also support for complex numbers, but we won't get into that for this workshop. Integers are whole numbers, while floats are numbers with decimal points. When you perform arithmetic operations on integers, they might return floats, but the reverse is not true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a table of basic arithmetic operations you can perform on numerical data. You can combine an operation with an equals sign `=` to perform the operation and set the variable equal to the result in one line (eg `x += 1` adds 1 to whatever number `x` was).\n",

If there is a string that contains a quote, you can use the escape character `\\` to escape the quote. You can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings or the `*` operator to repeat a string. But you can't combine string with numerical data using these operators. You can use the `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions to convert between data types. You can do some special operations on strings, such as indexing, slicing and formatting. Indexing and slicing extract substrings from a string, while formatting allows you to insert variables into a string. String are **immutable**, meaning you can't edit a string, but you can create a new string from an existing one.\n",

Modifying in place means you don't have to assign the result of the method to a new variable, while returning a new object means you do have to assign it. For example, `list.append(x)` updates the list in place, while `list.pop()` both returns the last element and removes it from the list in place. \n",

Those form the basis of data analysis and plotting in python. The \"Getting started\" instructions will have already walked you through installing the libraries, but to actually use them in your code or jupyter notebook, they need to be imported. You can import an installed library with the `import` keyword, typically at the top of your script/notebook. You can also import specific functions or classes from a library using the `from` keyword. Run the code block below and notice that the libraries are imported with a shorthand name.

The first object that `plt.subplots()` returns is a `matplotlib.figure.Figure` instance. It is a top-level container for all plot elements. This object is like the **canvas** of a painting, and holds parameters such as the size of the entire plot, the background color, how subplots are layed out, etc. The `Figure` also holds all the `Axes` which are the actual plots that are going to be drawn. The second object is a `matplotlib.axes.Axes` object. Think of this like an **artist** that *draws* on the canvas. When customizing plots, such as choosing which data to plot, how to plot it, and in what colors or shapes, you will be interacting with the `Axes` object. \n",

Now, we will learn how to plot with the library seaborn, which is built on top of this interface and takes care of a lot of the details for you.
