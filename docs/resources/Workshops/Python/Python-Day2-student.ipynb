    "Hello and welcome to our workshop on writing functions in python. Today we'll go over the basic formatting for writing functions, variable scoping, control flow, and more. If this is your first day attending this workshop series, please make sure you've created an environment with the necessary packages.\n",

    "## Installing/running this notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this notebook by uploading it to Google Colab. You can also run it on your own computer by installing Jupyter Notebook and either running jupyter in your browser or using an IDE like VSCode. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run this using Google Colab, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and upload this notebook. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this locally, you will need to install python, anaconda, and the necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. If you are on Windows, [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once WSL is installed, you'll have a Linux terminal available to you in Windows. You can open this terminal by typing \"wsl\" in the search bar and clicking the app that appears. You'll also find your Linux distribution as a mounted drive in your file explorer.\n",
    "1. Install mamba, a package manager using the command line - Terminal for Mac or WSL for Windows. \n",
    "    1.1. For Mac, if you already have brew installed, install mamba using `brew install miniforge` and initialize it using `conda init zsh`. Then restart your terminal. If you don't have homebrew (i.e. the brew command doesn't exist), install brew first using `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n",
    "    1.2. For Windows, download the Linux (x86_64) installer from the miniforge repository [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and install with `bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh`.\n",
    "2. Create a new environment using mamba with `mamba create -n pyworkshop numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter` and activate it with `conda activate pyworkshop`.\n",
    "3. You can now run the jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal. This will open a browser window with the jupyter notebook interface. You can navigate to the folder where you saved this notebook and open it.\n",
    "4. Alternatively, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the Python extension. Then open this notebook in VSCode and run it with the kernel that belongs to the pyworkshop environment. [How to guide here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)"

    "# Thinking algorithmically\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with learning about what a function in python is, how to define them, and how to control them, let's do some non-coding exercises to get in the mindset of thinking algorithmically. One of the major hurdles to writing your own functions or computer programs is changing the way you think to match the way a computer or coding language evaluates words. Much of the difficulty is ameliorated if we practice breaking down our problems into discrete chunks. Then, taking each chunk and putting it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of thinking about code is to break down actions into logical steps, such as by writing **pseudocode**. Below is an example of pseudocode for making French-style scrambled eggs:\n",

    "Combine eggs, salt, cream in bowl\n",

These conditional expressions can then be combined with logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. They mostly work like you'd expect from natural language.

    "**Write lots of functions! Functionalize everything!**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons to write functions, even if you think you might only use it once in your notebook or workflow. Using functions in your code improves the readability of the code, because rather than puzzle through many lines trying to interpret what was going on, you can just read the function name/description and understand what happened. It also improves readability by allowing the reader to focus on the important parts of the code rather than functions that may perform rote tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions make your code more modular and reproducible. By breaking down the analysis into discrete chunks, you can easily swap out functions to test things or move sections of code around because functions are very portable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions also make your code more testable. When you encounter a bug or an unexpected outcome, you can more easily trace the source of the problem if you have functions that are well-documented and do one thing. Think of it like mixing smaller batches of reagents that you use at a time rather than one big container. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Document your functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step towards having a readable and well-documented function is to choose a descriptive name for it. The name should use a verb like \"plot\" or \"calculate\". Try and follow some consistent naming conventions with regard to capitalization and underscores. It'll be easier to remember what your functions are called if you don't mix up conventions like \"plot\" and \"Plot\" or \"plot_this\" and \"plotThis\". For more guidance, see the [python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step when writing functions: it is good practice to annotate it with what it does. That way, when future you or someone else reads it, the function's useage is immediately clear. You can annotate functions with a triple quote at the beginning of a function body, which is called a **docstring**. Typical contents of a docstring are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* one sentence describing the usage\n",
    "* list of all parameters and what type they should be\n",
    "* what the function returns\n",
    "\n",
    "See below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate the nth number in the fibonacci sequence\n",
    "    Input: n, an integer\n",
    "    Returns: the nth number in the fibonacci sequence, an integer\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    elif n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you are encouraged to write comments in your code. Comments in python are prefixed with a `#` and a good rule of thumb is to write a comment for every chunk of code that does something specific, or if it is not obvious why you had to write code that way. These comments will primarily benefit yourself for when you go back to your code and ask yourself \"why did I do it this way?\". It's good practice to have comments exist on their own line rather than in-line with your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions should do ONE thing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are meant to do one thing, just like a sentence is meant to express a complete thought. If you bundle your entire analysis into a single function, it's akin to writing a run-on sentence by abusing colons, semi-colons, etc. It might be correct and it might run, but it will be hard to read and also hard to debug. Make liberal use of calling functions within functions and making your code modular. "
