## Git terms

<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a program that stores the history of files in any directory that has been initialized as a git repository. Used in conjunction with web-based platforms this makes for a powerful collaboration tool.
However, there are many terms associated with Git that may be confusing. In essence, many of these terms are simply other words for "a copy" or "copying" a directory, however with slight distinctions.
This table tries to define these terms clearly.
