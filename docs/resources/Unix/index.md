Under this section, we will collect resources for command line tools for bioinformatics. We have a workshop called "Bioinformatics Tips And Tricks" where we learn about common bioinformatics software and data types. It's a four-part series. 

Go to [Part 1](Biotips-workshop-2023-Day1.md), where we cover FASTA files, SAM/BAM files, and samtools. 

Go to [Part 2](Biotips-workshop-2023-Day2.md), where we cover bedfiles and bedtools, and a little bit of awk. 

Go to [Part 3](Biotips-workshop-2023-Day3.md), where we cover GFF and VCF files and the basics of bash scripting.

Go to [Part 4](Biotips-workshop-2023-Day4.md), where we go over more awk commands, and get more in depth with bash scripting.
