### The Baton Pass: preparing your data for the hand-off TWO PART SERIES

**Part 1 April 21, 1 - 2 PM in person in Northwest Building 453**

**Part 2 April 28, 1 - 2 PM in person in Northwest Building 425**

In this two part hands-on workshop, we will provide you with the tools and procedures to make your research data self-documenting, saving yourself and future colleagues the headache of retracing your steps. In the first session, we will go over a template for creating an onboarding document and an offboarding checklist that is specific to those of us who deal with biological data. In the second session, we will look at a real example use case for these documents and also provide one-on-one assistance with filling out your own. By the end of this workshop, students will be able to identify key institutional knowledge they need to pass on and will come away with a ready to use documentation workflow that works for them. 

### Dataverse step-by-step for biology: how to archive & publish your data

**May 12, 1 - 3 PM in person in Northwest Building 453**

In this seminar + Q&A, guest speaker Katie Mika (MLS, Data Services Librarian) will be presenting a step-by-step guide for archiving & publishing your biological data in the Harvard Dataverse. Harvard Dataverse is a generalist repository for any kind of research data, big or small.

## :pizza: Programming and Pizza :pizza:
**April 9th 4 PM - 6 PM Northwest Building B227.45**

New for this month, we are going to start having extended office hours hangouts every second Wednesday of the month with free pizza! Come hang out and work on your code or data analysis while eating pizza! Meet w/other folks who also code, ask our expert bioinformaticians for advice, or solve a programming puzzle for practice!

Our first one is on April 9th! Come chat, work, and hang out! Register above!

### 1 hour seminars

We will be offering three 1-hour seminars on Wednesdays in March. *All seminars will be hybrid on zoom and in person in the Northwest Building meeting room B253*

**March 5 11AM-12PM - Introduction to Genome Annotation** 

The seminar will consist of a broad overview of what genome annotation is, an explanation of the various approaches and how they differ, and discussion of what metrics one should consider using to evaluate genome annotation quality. Students will learn how to pick the right tool for annotation and how to evaluate the product of that tool.

**March 12 11AM-12PM - Introduction to scRNA analysis**

This seminar provides a gentle introduction to the motivations for scRNAseq, the current technologies available from to design your single-cell experiment, the distinct data processing challenges that scRNAseq presents (compared to bulk RNAseq), and basic data processing and analysis steps that are the foundation for performing downstream analyses aimed at generating deeper biological insights.

**March 26 11AM-12PM - Installing & Managing software (Conda, Containers)** 

This seminar is intended for people who use (or may use) command line softwares and programs and assumes basic command line knowledge. We will learn about why software management is challenging, how to create and share conda environments, and how to use docker/singularity containers. We will be using the command line on the Cannon cluster, but these concepts can be translated to working on your local computer as well.

### :heart::bar_chart:Love Data Month (Februray 2025):bar_chart::heart:

February is Love Data Month! We are offering 3 different activities in the spirit of data management.

**:heart: Data Visualization Spa**

We are opening a **Data Visualization Spa** from **February 10th - 14th**. [Sign up](https://calendar.app.google/YqfghHzuymnVHN1y6) for a 30-minute consultation with our team to give your tired and frazzled data visualization code (in R or python) a refreshing spa treatment! We will help you write more readable and efficient figure-generating code, annotate and organize your scripts to improve reproducibility, and more! Click *"Jump to the next available date"* on the calendar signup to see all available slots.

**:heart: Publishing your data analysis on GitHub**

!!! Note
    This will be offered in person and virtually. Pick which day works best for you!

    **[February 18th, 10 AM - 12 PM in person room #LL03 in Cabot Library](https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/event/14066629)**

    **[February 20th, 10AM - 12 PM virtual](https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/event/14068907)**

Do you need to share your data analysis code but don't know where to start? Is the GitHub website too confusing to navigate? We can help! Join us for a 2 hour seminar in which we will learn about what git/GitHub is, what is good to share of your analysis, how to organize your project code before publishing it, and of course, how to use GitHub as a publishing platform. We recommend this talk for those who would like to improve their open science practices. No coding background is expected.

**:heart: Version Control and Collaboration using git/GitHub**

!!! Note
    This will be offered in person and virtually. Pick which day works best for you!

    **[February 25th 10 AM - 12 PM in person room #LL03 in Cabot Library](https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/event/14067087)**

    **[February 27th 10 AM - 12 PM virtual](https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/event/14068912)**

Do you want to keep track of changes in your code, collaborate with others, or share your code with the world? Join us for a 2 hour hands-on workshop in that aims to teach the basics of using git/GitHub for version control of your project code. We will also cover collaborating on the same project with other people and how to manage conflicts. This workshop is recommended for researchers who want to integrate git into their coding or data analysis practice. Some familiarity with command line tools will be helpful, but is not required.
