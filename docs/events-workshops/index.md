The FAS Informatics Group creates hosts events such as workshops, both online and in-person. Here is a list of upcoming events, as well as current and past workshop content!

## Upcoming workshops

### 1 hour seminars

We will be offering three 1-hour seminars on Wednesdays in March. *All seminars will be hybrid on zoom and in person in the Northwest Building meeting room B253*

**March 5 11AM-12PM - Introduction to Genome Annotation** 

The seminar will consist of a broad overview of what genome annotation is, an explanation of the various approaches and how they differ, and discussion of what metrics one should consider using to evaluate genome annotation quality. Students will learn how to pick the right tool for annotation and how to evaluate the product of that tool.

**March 12 11AM-12PM - Introduction to scRNA analysis**

This seminar provides a gentle introduction to the motivations for scRNAseq, the current technologies available from to design your single-cell experiment, the distinct data processing challenges that scRNAseq presents (compared to bulk RNAseq), and basic data processing and analysis steps that are the foundation for performing downstream analyses aimed at generating deeper biological insights.

**March 26 11AM-12PM - Installing & Managing software (Conda, Containers)** 

This seminar is intended for people who use (or may use) command line softwares and programs and assumes basic command line knowledge. We will learn about why software management is challenging, how to create and share conda environments, and how to use docker/singularity containers. We will be using the command line on the Cannon cluster, but these concepts can be translated to working on your local computer as well.

### Healthy Habits for Data Science (Spring 2024)

This workshop aims to teach students how to be more effective at working on their projects using reproducible habits. We learn how to organize projects on the local machine as well as the Cannon cluster, how to manage software environments, how to use git and GitHub to track code changes, and how to write and scale scripts on an HPC. Loose transcripts of the lectures are available below. Download the pdfs of the slides (if applicable) to follow along with the lecture.

### Unix tips and tricks for bioinformatics (Spring 2024)

This workshop aims to introduce students to some basic bioinformatics file formats, tools, and general best practices. The first two days of the workshop will be dedicated to introductions of bioinformatics file formats and the command line tools that we use to view, manipulate, and analyze them. After that, we will begin to shift from using individual commands to writing shell scripts and constructing bioinformatics workflows.

### Introduction to R (Fall 2023)

This workshop aims to introduce first-time users to the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) development environment. We will provide a basic introduction to coding in R and then shift to data manipulation using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a set of R libraries designed to handle data tables in a consistent and easy way. Then, we'll learn how to generate some basic plots to explore our data using [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). You do not need any prior programming experience to take this workshop. But also note that this workshop is not a comprehensive programming class nor a comprehensive statistics class. The main goal of this workshop is to get you familiar with reading your data into R and performing basic operations and generating figures.
