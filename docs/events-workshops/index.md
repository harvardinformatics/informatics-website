# Events & Workshops

The FAS Informatics Group creates hosts events such as workshops, both online and in-person. Here is a list of upcoming events, as well as current and past workshop content!

## Upcoming Events & Workshops

### :material-tools: Workshops

A workshops below will be held in person in Northwest Building 453 and will meet on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays. Registration for all workshops is free. **Please do not register unless you can commit to attending** as spots are limited by the size of the space reservation!

#### Introduction to R

*Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30-12:30 from October 14, 2025 to October 23, 2025*

*Northwest Building 453*

Introduction to R is a 4 day workshop that prepares students to manipulate and plot data in RStudio using the R programming language. This course assumes no coding background and is suitable for beginners. This is an updated version of our previous Introduction to R workshop. [See below](#introduction-to-r-fall-2023) for more details.

#### Introduction to Nextflow

*Nextflow Run: November 13, 2025 9:30 AM - 12:30 PM*

*Nextflow Develop: November 20, 2025 9:30 AM - 12:30 PM*

*Northwest Building 453*

This 2 part intermediate level workshop will introduce students to [Nextflow :octicons-link-external-24:](https://nextflow.io/){:target="_blank"}, a workflow management system that allows you to create reproducible and scalable data analysis pipelines. In the first session we will cover understanding the basics of **running** a Nextflow workflow. In the second session, we will build on the first session and learn how to **write** a Nextflow workflow from scratch.

Pre-requisites:

* A FASRC Cannon account (if you want to run things on the cluster)
* A GitHub account (we will be using github codespaces)
* Does not have to have written any scripts themselves
* Can navigate the Terminal using command line. 
* Can read basic BASH scripts
* Has previously run SBATCH jobs on the cluster
* Has previously run command line software before
* Has used conda or singularity in the past to manage software

!!! Note
    If you only want to learn how to run Nextflow workflows, you may sign up for Nextflow Run only. However, if you want to learn how to convert your own scripts into Nextflow workflows, you must sign up for both Nextflow Run and Nextflow Develop.

### :material-monitor-account: Short Trainings (virtual)

<!-- #### The Baton Pass: Data Onboarding and Offboarding

*August 27, 2025 11 AM - 1 PM*

This training will focus on the best practices for onboarding and offboarding data in research projects. We will cover how to document data sources, ensure reproducibility, and maintain data integrity throughout the project lifecycle. We will go over a template for creating an onboarding document and an offboarding checklist that is specific to those of us who deal with biological data.

*December 3, 2025 12 PM - 1 PM*

This short training will consist of a broad overview of what genome annotation is, an explanation of the various approaches and how they differ, and discussion of what metrics one should consider using to evaluate genome annotation quality. Students will learn how to pick the right tool for annotation and how to evaluate the product of that tool.

### :fontawesome-brands-python: Introduction to Python Intensive (September 2025)

This is a six day workshop that will introduce students to Python as a data science language. We teach the basics of programming and logic in the context of Python and go on to show the tools that use Python for modern data analysis. This assumes no prior knowledge of Python, but will move at a quick pace to cover all the content. The workshop meets for 3 hours for 4 sessions.

### :material-food-apple-outline: Healthy Habits for Data Science (Spring 2024)

This workshop aims to teach students how to be more effective at working on their projects using reproducible habits. We learn how to organize projects on the local machine as well as the Cannon cluster, how to manage software environments, how to use git and GitHub to track code changes, and how to write and scale scripts on an HPC.

### :material-application-brackets-outline: Unix tips and tricks for bioinformatics (Spring 2024)

This workshop aims to introduce students to some basic bioinformatics file formats, tools, and general best practices. The first two days of the workshop will be dedicated to introductions of bioinformatics file formats and the command line tools that we use to view, manipulate, and analyze them. After that, we will begin to shift from using individual commands to writing shell scripts and constructing bioinformatics workflows.

### :material-language-r: Introduction to R (Fall 2023)

This workshop aims to introduce first-time users to the [R programming language :octicons-link-external-24:](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} and the [RStudio :octicons-link-external-24:](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank"} development environment. We will provide a basic introduction to coding in R and then shift to data manipulation using the [tidyverse :octicons-link-external-24:](https://www.tidyverse.org/){:target="_blank"}, a set of R libraries designed to handle data tables in a consistent and easy way. Then, we'll learn how to generate some basic plots to explore our data using [ggplot :octicons-link-external-24:](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){:target="_blank"}. You do not need any prior programming experience to take this workshop. But also note that this workshop is not a comprehensive programming class nor a comprehensive statistics class. The main goal of this workshop is to get you familiar with reading your data into R and performing basic operations and generating figures.

!!! warning "R workshop currently being updated"

    We are currently updating our R workshop for the fall 2025 session, so some material here may be out of date or incomplete. Check back soon for the most up to date material.
