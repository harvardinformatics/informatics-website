<!-- #### Command line 101: What's the deal with directories?

**Thursday February 5 2026, 11AM - 12PM**

Is this your first time sitting down typing commands into the command line or logging into the Cannon cluster to do your analysis? In this one hour seminar, we'll show you how files and directories are organized on the cluster, give tips on how to manage your own project directories, and more. You'll learn how to navigate a file system using the command line (aka the terminal), understand file permissions, and write files using the nano file editor. This seminar is suitable for absolute beginners to command line and cluster usage.

#### Command line 101: Tips & tricks for aspiring power users

**Thursday February 12 2026, 11AM - 12PM**

Now that you know how to move around the cluster, let's explore how to customize your command line experience. You'll learn about using dotfiles to automatically run things upon login, save and search your command  history, use terminal multiplexers like screen, and more. If you plan to spend a good amount of time running programs on the command line, this seminar will save you effort and make your experience smoother!

#### Command line 101: Integrating your local and cluster compute environments

**Thursday February 19 2026, 11AM - 12PM**

In this seminar, we will cover topics and allow you to seamlessly move between your local environment to the cluster computer environment by using tools like VSCode and various file transfer applications. Geared towards both beginner and intermediate users, students will learn how to use apps to help them program and process data like a pro.

**Thursday February 26 2026, 11AM - 12PM**

This is a hands-on training teaching how to use command line git to version control your code and how to use GitHub to backup your scripts. To participate in the hands-on portion of the workshop, please have a github account. Cannon cluster account is optional. Users are expected to know how to create files and directories using the command line.

## Latest Workshop Content

This section contains the most up-to-date content for our workshops! The date we last updated and ran the workshop is noted.

### :material-language-r: Introduction to R (Fall 2025)

This workshop aims to introduce first-time users to the [R programming language :octicons-link-external-24:](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} and the [RStudio :octicons-link-external-24:](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank"} development environment. This 4 session workshop will provide a basic introduction to coding in R and then shift to data manipulation using the [tidyverse :octicons-link-external-24:](https://www.tidyverse.org/){:target="_blank"}, a set of R libraries designed to handle data tables in a consistent and easy way. Then, we'll learn how to generate some basic plots to explore our data using [ggplot :octicons-link-external-24:](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){:target="_blank"}. You do not need any prior programming experience to take this workshop. But also note that this workshop is not a comprehensive programming class nor a comprehensive statistics class. The main goal of this workshop is to get you familiar with reading your data into R and performing basic operations and generating figures.

This course assumes no coding background and is suitable for beginners.
