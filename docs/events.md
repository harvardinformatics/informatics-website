# Events

## Current workshops

We are running a python intensive workshop this January 2025 term. This will be a 3 week workshop that runs twice per week for 3 hours each session. **The workshop will be held in person in Northwest Building 453. We will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30 AM - 12:30 PM from January 7 - January 22.**

Broadly, this workshop intends to be both an introduction to the concept of programming using python and an introduction to using python as a data science language. The first three days will be able the concept of programming while the last 3 days will be focused on introductory data analysis. You are welcome to jump in at any point, although we've intentionally made Days 1, 2, and 4 good starting points.
