## Current workshops

We have a full semester of workshops planned for the Fall 2024 semester. We will be offering standalone 1 hour in person workshops on a different topic every week. For your convenience, each topic will meet twice, on Tuesday from 9:30-10:30 and on Wednesday from 12:15-1:15. You can attend either session. **All 1 hour workshops will meet in Northwest Building Room 453**
