# About us

## Our Mission

The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Informatics Group (FAS Informatics) is a small group working in the cramped space between faculty, core facilities and high performance computing. We have a number of core responsibilities including first pass analysis for the sequencing core and software/analysis support for the proteomics mass-spectrometry core. We also support the infrastructure for instrument scheduling and invoicing across many FAS facilities.

A large part of our remit is to smooth the path of scientific discovery by working with faculty, post-docs and grad students to design and analyze sequencing experiments for the most efficient bang for the buck.
