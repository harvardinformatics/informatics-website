# About us

## Our Mission

The Informatics and Scientific Applications group is a small group working in the cramped space between faculty, core facilities and high performance computing. We have a number of core responsibilities including first pass analysis for the sequencing core and software/analysis support for the proteomics mass-spectrometry core. We also support the infrastructure for instrument scheduling and invoicing across many FAS facilities.

A large part of our remit is to smooth the path of scientific discovery by working with faculty, post-docs and grad students to design and analyze sequencing experiments for the most efficient bang for the buck. Our group is currently small (two bioinformaticians and two web developers) so we have limited resources to fulfill this area but we are aiming to grow and expand our services.
