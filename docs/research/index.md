# Research

Research in the Bioinformatics Group is primarily driven by collaborative projects with faculty on campus, and by grant-funded internal projects. However, we also conduct some best practices and methdological research to fill gaps in current knowledge and solve challenging bioinformatics problems. 


## Collaborations

### Assembling Difficult and Repetitive Genomes

A major focus of the group recently has been to assist with the assembly of complex genomes with long-read sequencing data. In collaboration with the Bauer Core, we support assembly with both PacBio HiFi and Nanopore technologies. Some recent examples include our work helping to assemble:
- the 6 Gb genome of *Phlox drummondii* (collaboration with the [Hopkins lab](https://hopkins-lab.org/))
- a variety of parasitic plant genomes (collaboration with the [Davis lab](https://davislab.oeb.harvard.edu/))
- a variety of undersampled invertebrate phyla (collaboration with the [Giribet lab](https://giribetgroup.oeb.harvard.edu/))

We are always excited to work on new and challenging genomes.

## Grant funded research

The group is also supported by several research grants, which fund postdoctoral research in the Bioinformatics group. Our major research interests revolve around understanding the genomic basis of convergent evolution.

### Convergent evolution

Convergent evolution describes the phenomenon where a similar or identical phenotype evolves in multiple independent lineages. Classic examples include diverse traits such as the evolution of echolocation in bats, cetaceans, and some species of birds; the recurrent evolution of crab-like body plans in crustaceans (carcinisation); and loss of limbs in snakes and caecilians. 

Our work in this area - funded by NSF and NIH grants - has focused on 

(including: nectar, brood parasite, ratite/NIH enhancer work)
