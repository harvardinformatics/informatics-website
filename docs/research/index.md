# Research

Research in the Bioinformatics Group is primarily driven by collaborative projects with faculty on campus, and by grant-funded internal projects. However, we also conduct some best practices and methdological research to fill gaps in current knowledge and solve challenging bioinformatics problems. Here, we outline some recent examples of these kinds of project.

We also develop methods, which can generally be found on our software page.

## Collaborations

### Assembling Difficult and Repetitive Genomes

(Davis lab; Hopkins lab; Giribet lab)

### Genomic signatures of sexual reproduction in bdelloid rotifers 

(Meselson - genetics paper)

### Phylogenetic methods to detect rate shifts in conserved elements

(PhyloAcc work)

### Methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data

(D4ALT; Hierfit; scclusteval)

## Best practices and methodological research

### Genome annotation

(Adam's stuff)

### snpArcher

(pop gen work)

### RNA-seq analysis

(Adam's papers on various things and general ideas about how to move forward with automated analysis of RNA-seq data)

## Grant funded research

### Convergent evolution

(including: nectar, brood parasite, ratite/NIH enhancer work)

### Comparative population genetics
