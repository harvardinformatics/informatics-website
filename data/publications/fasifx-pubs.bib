   abstract = {Stem-cell-derived tissues could transform disease research and therapy, yet most methods generate functionally immature products. We investigate how human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) differentiate into pancreatic islets in vitro by profiling DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone modification changes. We find that enhancer potential is reset upon lineage commitment and show how pervasive epigenetic priming steers endocrine cell fates. Modeling islet differentiation and maturation regulatory circuits reveals genes critical for generating endocrine cells and identifies circadian control as limiting for in vitro islet function. Entrainment to circadian feeding/fasting cycles triggers islet metabolic maturation by inducing cyclic synthesis of energy metabolism and insulin secretion effectors, including antiphasic insulin and glucagon pulses. Following entrainment, hPSC-derived islets gain persistent chromatin changes and rhythmic insulin responses with a raised glucose threshold, a hallmark of functional maturity, and function within days of transplantation. Thus, hPSC-derived tissues are amenable to functional improvement by circadian modulation.},

   abstract = {Despite more than 2,000-fold variation in genome size, key features of genome architecture are largely conserved across angiosperms. Parasitic plants have elucidated the many ways in which genomes can be modified, yet we still lack comprehensive genome data for species that represent the most extreme form of parasitism. Here, we present the highly modified genome of the iconic endophytic parasite Sapria himalayana Griff. (Rafflesiaceae), which lacks a typical plant body. First, 44% of the genes conserved in eurosids are lost in Sapria, dwarfing previously reported levels of gene loss in vascular plants. These losses demonstrate remarkable functional convergence with other parasitic plants, suggesting a common genetic roadmap underlying the evolution of plant parasitism. Second, we identified extreme disparity in intron size among retained genes. This includes a category of genes with introns longer than any so far observed in angiosperms, nearing 100 kb in some cases, and a second category of genes with exceptionally short or absent introns. Finally, at least 1.2% of the Sapria genome, including both genic and intergenic content, is inferred to be derived from host-to-parasite horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) and includes genes potentially adaptive for parasitism. Focused phylogenomic reconstruction of HGTs reveals a hidden history of former host-parasite associations involving close relatives of Sapria's modern hosts in the grapevine family. Our findings offer a unique perspective into how deeply angiosperm genomes can be altered to fit an extreme form of plant parasitism and demonstrate the value of HGTs as DNA fossils to investigate extinct symbioses.},

   abstract = {A major goal of research in evolution and genetics is linking genotype to phenotype. This work could be direct, such as determining the genetic basis of a phenotype by leveraging genetic variation or divergence in a developmental, physiological, or behavioral trait. The work could also involve studying the evolutionary phenomena (e.g., reproductive isolation, adaptation, sexual dimorphism, behavior) that reveal an indirect link between genotype and a trait of interest. When the phenotype diverges across evolutionarily distinct lineages, this genotype-to-phenotype problem can be addressed using phylogenetic genotype-to-phenotype (PhyloG2P) mapping, which uses genetic signatures and convergent phenotypes on a phylogeny to infer the genetic bases of traits. The PhyloG2P approach has proven powerful in revealing key genetic changes associated with diverse traits, including the mammalian transition to marine environments and transitions between major mechanisms of photosynthesis. However, there are several intermediate traits layered in between genotype and the phenotype of interest, including but not limited to transcriptional profiles, chromatin states, protein abundances, structures, modifications, metabolites, and physiological parameters. Each intermediate trait is interesting and informative in its own right, but synthesis across data types has great promise for providing a deep, integrated, and predictive understanding of how genotypes drive phenotypic differences and convergence. We argue that an expanded PhyloG2P framework (the PhyloG2P matrix) that explicitly considers intermediate traits, and imputes those that are prohibitive to obtain, will allow a better mechanistic understanding of any trait of interest. This approach provides a proxy for functional validation and mechanistic understanding in organisms where laboratory manipulation is impractical.},

We describe a diverse landscape of transposable elements and satellite repeats, estimate a long-term effective population size of ~240,000, identify a diverse suite of olfactory receptor genes and an opsin repertoire with sensitivity in the ultraviolet range, show that the wingless moa phenotype is likely not attributable to gene loss or pseudogenization, and identify potential function-altering coding sequence variants in moa that could be synthesized for future functional assays.

Using 45 long-read de novo genome assemblies and pangenome tools, we analyze SVs within three closely related species of North American jays (Aphelocoma, scrub-jays) displaying a 60-fold range in effective population size. We find rapid evolution of genome architecture, including ∼100 Mb variation in genome size driven by dynamic satellite landscapes with unexpectedly long (&gt; 10 kb) repeat units and widespread variation in gene content, influencing gene expression. SVs exhibit slightly deleterious dynamics modulated by variant length and population size, with strong evidence of adaptive fixation only in large populations. Our results demonstrate how population size shapes the distribution of SVs and the importance of pangenomes to characterizing genomic diversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {De novo transcriptome assembly is a powerful tool, and has been widely used over the last decade for making evolutionary inferences. However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30% to 83%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent underestimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein-coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method, length-rescaled CPM, to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates. Researchers should consider ways to minimize the impact of bias in transcriptome assemblies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Typical experimental design advice for expression analyses using RNA-seq generally assumes that single-end reads provide robust gene-level expression estimates in a cost-effective manner, and that the additional benefits obtained from paired-end sequencing are not worth the additional cost. However, in many cases (e.g., with Illumina NextSeq and NovaSeq instruments), shorter paired-end reads and longer single-end reads can be generated for the same cost, and it is not obvious which strategy should be preferred. Using publicly available data, we test whether short-paired end reads can achieve more robust expression estimates and differential expression results than single-end reads of approximately the same total number of sequenced bases. RESULTS: At both the transcript and gene levels, 2 x 40 paired-end reads unequivocally provide expression estimates that are more highly correlated with 2 x 125 than 1 x 75 reads; in nearly all cases, those correlations are also greater than for 1 x 125, despite the greater total number of sequenced bases for the latter. Across an array of metrics, differential expression tests based upon 2 x 40 consistently outperform those using 1 x 75. CONCLUSION: Researchers seeking a cost-effective approach for gene-level expression analysis should prefer short paired-end reads over a longer single-end strategy. Short paired-end reads will also give reasonably robust expression estimates and differential expression results at the isoform level.},

In this perspective, we review these new technologies and discuss their potential impact on gene expression studies in non-model organisms. Although traditional RNA-sequencing methods have been an extraordinarily powerful tool to apply functional genomics in an ecological context, bulk RNA-seq approaches often rely on de novo transcriptome assembly, and cannot capture expression changes in rare cell populations or distinguish shifts in cell type abundance. Advancements in genome assembly technology, particularly long-read sequencing, and improvements in the scalability of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offer unprecedented resolution in understanding cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. We discuss the potential of these technologies to enable disentangling differential gene regulation from cell type composition differences and uncovering subtle expression patterns masked by bulk RNA-seq. The integration of these approaches provides a more nuanced understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of gene expression, paving the way for refined models and deeper insights into the generation of biodiversity.},

   abstract = {Recent technological advances in long-read DNA sequencing accompanied by reduction in costs have made the production of genome assemblies financially achievable and computationally feasible, such that genome assembly no longer represents the major hurdle to evolutionary analysis for most nonmodel organisms. Now, the more difficult challenge is to properly annotate a draft genome assembly once it has been constructed. The primary challenge to annotations is how to select from the myriad gene prediction tools that are currently available, determine what kinds of data are necessary to generate high-quality annotations, and evaluate the quality of the annotation. To determine which methods perform the best and to determine whether the inclusion of RNA-seq data is necessary to obtain a high-quality annotation, we generated annotations with 12 different methods for 21 different species spanning vertebrates, plants, and insects. We found that the annotation transfer method TOGA, BRAKER3, and the RNA-seq assembler StringTie were consistently top performers across a variety of metrics including BUSCO recovery, CDS length, and false-positive rate, with the exception that TOGA performed less well in some monocots with respect to BUSCO recovery. The choice of which of the top-performing methods will depend upon the feasibility of whole-genome alignment, availability of RNA-seq data, importance of capturing noncoding parts of the transcriptome, and, when whole-genome alignment is not feasible, the relative performance in BUSCO recovery between BRAKER3 and StringTie. When whole-genome alignment is not feasible, inclusion of RNA-seq data will lead to substantial improvements to genome annotations.},

Herein, we developed a nanobody-fused split O-GlcNAcase (OGA) as an O-GlcNAc eraser for selective deglycosylation of a target protein in cells. After systematic cellular optimization, we identified a split OGA with reduced inherent deglycosidase activity that selectively removed O-GlcNAc from the desired target protein when directed by a nanobody. We demonstrate the generality of the nanobody-fused split OGA using four nanobodies against five target proteins and use the system to study the impact of O-GlcNAc on the transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The nanobody-directed O-GlcNAc eraser provides a new strategy for the functional evaluation and engineering of O-GlcNAc via the selective removal of O-GlcNAc from individual proteins directly in cells.},

Gibbs sampling is used to assign rate categories (background, conserved, accelerated) to lineages and explore whether the assigned rate categories are associated with increases or decreases in the rate of trait evolution. We test our method using simulations and then illustrate its application using mammalian body size and lifespan data previously analyzed with respect to protein coding genes. Like other studies, we find processes such as tumor suppression, telomere maintenance, and p53 regulation to be related to changes in longevity and body size. In addition, we also find that skeletal genes, and developmental processes, such as sprouting angiogenesis, are relevant.},

   abstract = {Background: Analysis of scATAC-seq data has been recently scaled to thousands of cells. While processing of other types of single cell data was boosted by the implementation of alignment-free techniques, pipelines available to process scATAC-seq data still require large computational resources. We propose here an approach based on pseudoalignment, which reduces the execution times and hardware needs at little cost for precision. Methods: Public data for 10k PBMC were downloaded from 10x Genomics web site. Reads were aligned to various references derived from DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHS) using kallisto and quantified with bustools. We compared our results with the ones publicly available derived by cellranger-atac. We subsequently tested our approach on scATAC-seq data for K562 cell line. Results: We found that kallisto does not introduce biases in quantification of known peaks; cells groups identified are consistent with the ones identified from standard method. We also found that cell identification is robust when analysis is performed using DHS-derived reference in place of de novo identification of ATAC peaks. Lastly, we found that our approach is suitable for reliable quantification of gene activity based on scATAC-seq signal, thus allows for efficient labelling of cell groups based on marker genes. Conclusions: Analysis of scATAC-seq data by means of kallisto produces results in line with standard pipelines while being considerably faster; using a set of known DHS sites as reference does not affect the ability to characterize the cell populations.},

   abstract = {A drastic transition at birth, from constant maternal nutrient supply in utero to intermittent postnatal feeding, requires changes in the metabolic system of the neonate. Despite their central role in metabolic homeostasis, little is known about how pancreatic beta cells adjust to the new nutritional challenge. Here, we find that after birth beta cell function shifts from amino acid- to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in correlation with the change in the nutritional environment. This adaptation is mediated by a transition in nutrient sensitivity of the mTORC1 pathway, which leads to intermittent mTORC1 activity. Disrupting nutrient sensitivity of mTORC1 in mature beta cells reverts insulin secretion to a functionally immature state. Finally, manipulating nutrient sensitivity of mTORC1 in stem cell-derived beta cells in vitro strongly enhances their glucose-responsive insulin secretion. These results reveal a mechanism by which nutrients regulate beta cell function, thereby enabling a metabolic adaptation for the newborn.},

   abstract = {Conservation of DNA sequence over evolutionary time is a strong indicator of function, and gain or loss of sequence conservation can be used to infer changes in function across a phylogeny. Changes in evolutionary rates on particular lineages in a phylogeny can indicate shared functional shifts, and thus can be used to detect genomic correlates of phenotypic convergence. However, existing methods do not allow easy detection of patterns of rate variation, which causes challenges for detecting convergent rate shifts or other complex evolutionary scenarios. Here we introduce PhyloAcc, a new Bayesian method to model substitution rate changes in conserved elements across a phylogeny. The method assumes several categories of substitution rate for each branch on the phylogenetic tree, estimates substitution rates per category, and detects changes of substitution rate as the posterior probability of a category switch. Simulations show that PhyloAcc can detect genomic regions with rate shifts in multiple target species better than previous methods and has a higher accuracy of reconstructing complex patterns of substitution rate changes than prevalent Bayesian relaxed clock models. We demonstrate the utility of PhyloAcc in two classic examples of convergent phenotypes: loss of flight in birds and the transition to marine life in mammals. In each case, our approach reveals numerous examples of conserved nonexonic elements with accelerations specific to the phenotypically convergent lineages. Our method is widely applicable to any set of conserved elements where multiple rate changes are expected on a phylogeny.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to an explosion in novel methods to study biological variation among individual cells, and to classify cells into functional and biologically meaningful categories. RESULTS: Here, we present a new cell type projection tool, Hierarchical Random Forest for Information Transfer (HieRFIT), based on hierarchical random forests. HieRFIT uses a priori information about cell type relationships to improve classification accuracy, taking as input a hierarchical tree structure representing the class relationships, along with the reference data. We use an ensemble approach combining multiple random forest models, organized in a hierarchical decision tree structure. We show that our hierarchical classification approach improves accuracy and reduces incorrect predictions especially for inter-dataset tasks which reflect real-life applications. We use a scoring scheme that adjusts probability distributions for candidate class labels and resolves uncertainties while avoiding the assignment of cells to incorrect types by labeling cells at internal nodes of the hierarchy when necessary. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: HieRFIT is implemented as an R package, and it is available at (https://github.com/yasinkaymaz/HieRFIT/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

   abstract = {Evolutionary convergence has been long considered primary evidence of adaptation driven by natural selection and provides opportunities to explore evolutionary repeatability and predictability. In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying convergent evolution, in part, owing to the advent of genomic techniques. However, the current 'genomics gold rush' in studies of convergence has overshadowed the reality that most trait classifications are quite broadly defined, resulting in incomplete or potentially biased interpretations of results. Genomic studies of convergence would be greatly improved by integrating deep 'vertical', natural history knowledge with 'horizontal' knowledge focusing on the breadth of taxonomic diversity. Natural history collections have and continue to be best positioned for increasing our comprehensive understanding of phenotypic diversity, with modern practices of digitization and databasing of morphological traits providing exciting improvements in our ability to evaluate the degree of morphological convergence. Combining more detailed phenotypic data with the well-established field of genomics will enable scientists to make progress on an important goal in biology: to understand the degree to which genetic or molecular convergence is associated with phenotypic convergence. Although the fields of comparative biology or comparative genomics alone can separately reveal important insights into convergent evolution, here we suggest that the synergistic and complementary roles of natural history collection-derived phenomic data and comparative genomics methods can be particularly powerful in together elucidating the genomic basis of convergent evolution among higher taxa. This article is part of the theme issue 'Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions'.},

Our assembly combines Nanopore and Illumina sequencing technologies and makes use of a whole-genome amplification, to generate enough DNA to sequence this small meiofaunal species. We generated a moderately contiguous assembly (2,547 scaffolds), with a high level of completeness (metazoan BUSCOs n = 954, single-copy complete = 89.6%, duplicated = 3.9%, fragmented = 3.5%, and missing = 3.0%). We then screened the genome for homologs of the Halloween genes, key genes implicated in the ecdysis (molting) pathway of arthropods, recovering a putative homolog of shadow. The presence of a shadow ortholog in two priapulan genomes suggests that the Halloween genes may not have evolved in a stepwise manner in Panarthropoda, as previously thought, but may have a deeper origin at the base of Ecdysozoa.},

Implemented in Snakemake, snpArcher is user-friendly, reproducible, and designed to be compatible with high-performance computing clusters and cloud environments. To demonstrate the flexibility of this pipeline, we applied snpArcher to 26 public resequencing data sets from nonmammalian vertebrates. These variant data sets are hosted publicly to enable future comparative population genomic analyses. With its extensibility and the availability of public data sets, snpArcher will contribute to a broader understanding of genetic variation across species by facilitating the rapid use and reuse of large genomic data sets.},

The chemoautotrophic symbionts of the hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, however, possess two functional pathways: the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) and the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles. How these two pathways are coordinated is unknown. Here we measured net carbon fixation rates, transcriptional/metabolic responses and transcriptional co-expression patterns of Riftia pachyptila endosymbionts by incubating tubeworms collected from the East Pacific Rise at environmental pressures, temperature and geochemistry. Results showed that rTCA and CBB transcriptional patterns varied in response to different geochemical regimes and that each pathway is allied to specific metabolic processes; the rTCA is allied to hydrogenases and dissimilatory nitrate reduction, whereas the CBB is allied to sulfide oxidation and assimilatory nitrate reduction, suggesting distinctive yet complementary roles in metabolic function. Furthermore, our network analysis implicates the rTCA and a group 1e hydrogenase as key players in the physiological response to limitation of sulfide and oxygen. Net carbon fixation rates were also exemplary, and accordingly, we propose that co-activity of CBB and rTCA may be an adaptation for maintaining high carbon fixation rates, conferring a fitness advantage in dynamic vent environments.},

   abstract = {Heterochromatin formation during early embryogenesis is timed precisely, but how this process is regulated remains elusive. We report the discovery of a histone methyltransferase complex whose nuclear accumulation and activation establish the onset of heterochromatin formation in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We find that the inception of heterochromatin generation coincides with the accumulation of the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase MET-2 (SETDB) into nuclear hubs. The absence of MET-2 results in delayed and disturbed heterochromatin formation, whereas accelerated nuclear localization of the methyltransferase leads to precocious H3K9 methylation. We identify two factors that bind to and function with MET-2: LIN-65, which resembles activating transcription factor 7-interacting protein (ATF7IP) and localizes MET-2 into nuclear hubs, and ARLE-14, which is orthologous to adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribosylation factor-like 14 effector protein (ARL14EP) and promotes stable association of MET-2 with chromatin. These data reveal that nuclear accumulation of MET-2 in conjunction with LIN-65 and ARLE-14 regulates timing of heterochromatin domains during embryogenesis.},

   abstract = {Parental care evolved as a strategy to enhance offspring survival at the cost of reduced fecundity. While most birds provide parental care, obligate brood parasites circumvent this tradeoff by exploiting the parental behavior of other species. This radical life history shift has occurred independently seven times in birds, offering an outstanding opportunity to test for convergent patterns of adaptation in the genome. To investigate genomic adaptations underlying this transition, we analyzed population resequencing data from five brood-parasitic species across three independent origins of brood parasitism — three parasitic finches (family Viduidae), a honeyguide, and a cowbird — alongside related non-parasitic (parental) outgroups. Using the McDonald-Kreitman framework, we found evidence for repeated adaptation in genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function in multiple parasitic clades, but not in the matched outgroup parental species. This is consistent with evidence for increased male-male competition in parasitic lineages as a result of the loss of parental care. In addition, we detected selective sweeps near genes associated with nervous system development in parasitic lineages, perhaps associated with improved spatial cognition that aids brood parasites in locating, monitoring, and laying eggs in host nests. Finally, we found more selective sweeps in host-specific brood parasites as compared to parental outgroups, perhaps reflecting ongoing host-parasite coevolutionary arms races.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   pages = {2024.08.30.610474},
   abstract = {Although high-sugar diets are associated with metabolic diseases in humans, several bird lineages have independently evolved to primarily subsist on simple sugars from flower nectar or fruits. In this study, we address a key question of the repeatability of molecular evolution by investigating the convergent and lineage-specific molecular mechanisms underlying dietary adaptations in four major sugar-consuming bird lineages: hummingbirds, parrots, honeyeaters, and sunbirds. We assembled nine new genomes for sugar-consuming species and their closely related non-sugar feeding outgroup species and generated 90 tissue-specific transcriptomes for six key species. We identified signatures of positive selection in both protein-coding and non-coding regulatory sequences, and found positive selection targets the same genes more frequently in sugar-feeders compared to non-sugar feeding controls, suggesting that adapting to a high-sugar diet requires changes in a limited number of genetic elements. At the functional level, pathways associated with energy homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism, heart function, and hormonal regulation showed convergent selection signals in both protein-coding and regulatory evolution, while lipid and amino acid metabolism demonstrated mostly regulatory evolution. Notably, we observed striking evidence for convergent adaptation in MLXIPL, a transcription factor regulating sugar and lipid homeostasis, manifesting in both sequence and regulatory changes across all sugar-feeders. With functional assays, we demonstrated that hummingbird MLXIPL enhances sugar-induced transcriptional activity in HEK239 cells, suggesting its central role in the evolution of adaptations to high-sugar diets. Our findings elucidate the main genomic targets in the evolution of sugar-feeding at both molecular and pathway levels. Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Many species throughout the animal kingdom naturally regenerate complex body parts following amputation. Most research in appendage regeneration has focused on identifying mechanisms that influence cell behaviors in the remaining stump tissue immediately adjacent to the injury site. Roles for activation steps that occur outside of the injury site remain largely unexplored, yet they may be critical for the regeneration process and may also shape the evolution of regeneration. Here, we discovered a role for the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in stimulating a body-wide stem cell activation response to amputation that drives limb regeneration. Notably, this systemic response is mediated by innervation at both the injury site and in distant, uninjured tissues, and by several signaling pathways, including adrenergic signaling. This work challenges the predominant conceptual framework considering the injury site alone in the regenerative response and argues instead for brain-body axis in stem cell activation as a priming step upon which molecular cues at the injury site then build tissue.Competing Interest StatementJ.

   abstract = {A core question in evolutionary biology is whether convergent phenotypic evolution is driven by convergent molecular changes in proteins or regulatory regions. We combined phylogenomic, developmental, and epigenomic analysis of 11 new genomes of paleognathous birds, including an extinct moa, to show that convergent evolution of regulatory regions, more so than protein-coding genes, is prevalent among developmental pathways associated with independent losses of flight. A Bayesian analysis of 284,001 conserved noncoding elements, 60,665 of which are corroborated as enhancers by open chromatin states during development, identified 2355 independent accelerations along lineages of flightless paleognaths, with functional consequences for driving gene expression in the developing forelimb. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape associated with morphological convergence in ratites has a substantial shared regulatory component.},

   abstract = {Echolocation, the detection of objects by means of sound waves, has evolved independently in diverse animals. Echolocators include not only mammals such as toothed whales and yangochiropteran and rhinolophoid bats but also Rousettus fruit bats, as well as two bird lineages, oilbirds and swiftlets. In whales and yangochiropteran and rhinolophoid bats, positive selection and molecular convergence has been documented in key hearing-related genes, such as prestin (SLC26A5), but few studies have examined these loci in other echolocators. Here, we examine patterns of selection and convergence in echolocation-related genes in echolocating birds and Rousettus bats. Fewer of these loci were under selection in Rousettus or birds compared with classically recognized echolocators, and elevated convergence (compared to outgroups) was not evident across this gene set. In certain genes, however, we detected convergent substitutions with potential functional relevance, including convergence between Rousettus and classic echolocators in prestin at a site known to affect hair cell electromotility. We also detected convergence between Yangochiroptera, Rhinolophidea, and oilbirds in TMC1, an important mechanosensory transduction channel in vertebrate hair cells, and observed an amino acid change at the same site within the pore domain. Our results suggest that although most proteins implicated in echolocation in specialized mammals may not have been recruited in birds or Rousettus fruit bats, certain hearing-related loci may have undergone convergent functional changes. Investigating adaptations in diverse echolocators will deepen our understanding of this unusual sensory modality.},

   abstract = {Genome assemblies are growing at an exponential rate and have proved indispensable for studying evolution but the effort has been biased toward vertebrates and arthropods with a particular focus on insects. Onychophora or velvet worms are an ancient group of cryptic, soil dwelling worms noted for their unique mode of prey capture, biogeographic patterns, and diversity of reproductive strategies. They constitute a poorly understood phylum of exclusively terrestrial animals that is sister group to arthropods. Due to this phylogenetic position, they are crucial in understanding the origin of the largest phylum of animals. Despite their significance, there is a paucity of genomic resources for the phylum with only one highly fragmented and incomplete genome publicly available. Initial attempts at sequencing an onychophoran genome proved difficult due to its large genome size and high repeat content. However, leveraging recent advances in long-read sequencing technology, we present here the first annotated draft genome for the phylum. With a total size of 5.6Gb, the gigantism of the Epiperipatus broadwayi genome arises from having high repeat content, intron size inflation, and extensive gene family expansion. Additionally, we report a previously unknown diversity of onychophoran hemocyanins that suggests the diversification of copper-mediated oxygen carriers occurred independently in Onychophora after its split from Arthropoda, parallel to the independent diversification of hemocyanins in each of the main arthropod lineages.},

Using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we report 51 phosphoproteins whose enrichment changes as a function of editing O-GlcNAc on CK2alpha, including HDAC1, HDAC2, ENSA, SMARCAD1, and PABPN1. Specific phosphosites on HDAC1 Ser393 and HDAC2 Ser394, both reported CK2 substrates, are significantly enhanced by O-GlcNAcylation of CK2alpha.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar traits in unrelated lineages across the Tree of Life. Various genomic signatures can help identify cases of convergent evolution at the molecular level, including changes in substitution rate in the same genes or gene networks. In this study, utilizing tarsus measurements of ~ 5400 species of birds, we identify independent shifts in tarsus length and use both comparative genomic and population genetic data to identify convergent evolutionary changes among focal clades with shifts to shorter optimal tarsus length. RESULTS: Using a newly generated, comprehensive and broadly accessible set of 932,467 avian conserved non-exonic elements (CNEEs) and a whole-genome alignment of 79 birds, we find strong evidence for convergent acceleration in short-tarsus clades among 14,422 elements. Analysis of 9854 protein-coding genes, however, yielded no evidence of convergent patterns of positive selection. Accelerated elements in short-tarsus clades are concentrated near genes with functions in development, with the strongest enrichment associated with skeletal system development. Analysis of gene networks supports convergent changes in regulation of broadly homologous limb developmental genes and pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the important role of regulatory elements undergoing convergent acceleration in convergent skeletal traits and are consistent with previous studies showing the roles of regulatory elements and skeletal phenotypes.},

During the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCS) by exogenous factors, numerous genes that affect the differentiation process are turned on and off autonomously. Manipulating these reactions could increase the efficiency of differentiation and provide a more complete control over the final composition of cell populations. To uncover in vitro autonomous responses, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on hESCs as they differentiate in spherical clusters. We observed that endocrine cells and their progenitors exist beside one another in separate compartments that activate distinct genetic pathways. WNT pathway inhibition in the endocrine domain of the differentiating clusters reveals a necessary role for the WNT inhibitor APC during islet formation in vivo. Accordingly, WNT inhibition in vitro causes an increase in the proportion of differentiated endocrine cells.},

By comparing our results with mammalian data, we find a significant enrichment for positively selected genes shared between taxa, and that these shared selected genes are enriched for viral immune pathways. Using pathogen-challenge transcriptome data, we show that genes up-regulated in response to pathogens are also enriched for positively selected genes. Together, our results suggest that pathogens, particularly viruses, consistently target the same genes across divergent clades, and that these genes are hotspots of host-pathogen conflict over deep evolutionary time.},

Scientific methods such as fluorescence labeling, nanoscale super-resolution microscopy, advances in single cell RNAseq and proteomics technologies, provide more detailed information about biological processes which were not evident with the analysis of bulk material. This new era of single-cell biology provides a better understanding of such complex biological systems as cancer, inflammation, immunity mechanism and aging processes, and opens the door into the field of drug response heterogeneity. The latest discoveries of cellular heterogeneity gives us a unique understanding of complex biological processes, such as disease mechanism, and will lead to new strategies for better and personalized treatment strategies. Recently, single-cell proteomics techniques that allow quantification of thousands of proteins from single mammalian cells have been introduced. Here we present an improved single-cell mass spectrometry-based proteomics platform called SCREEN (Single Cell pRotEomE aNalysis) for deep and high-throughput single-cell proteome coverage with high efficiency, less turnaround time and with an improved ability for protein quantitation across more cells than previously achieved. We applied this new platform to analyze the single-cell proteomic landscape under different drug treatment over time to uncover heterogeneity in cancer cell response, which for the first time, to our knowledge, has been achieved by mass spectrometry based analytical methods. We discuss challenges in single-cell proteomics, future improvements and general trends with the goal to encourage forthcoming technical developments.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: One major goal of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments is to identify novel cell types. With increasingly large scRNAseq datasets, unsupervised clustering methods can now produce detailed catalogues of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells in a sample. However, the interpretation of these clusters is challenging for both technical and biological reasons. Popular clustering algorithms are sensitive to parameter choices, and can produce different clustering solutions with even small changes in the number of principal components used, the k nearest neighbor and the resolution parameters, among others. RESULTS: Here, we present a set of tools to evaluate cluster stability by subsampling, which can guide parameter choice and aid in biological interpretation. The R package scclusteval and the accompanying Snakemake workflow implement all steps of the pipeline: subsampling the cells, repeating the clustering with Seurat and estimation of cluster stability using the Jaccard similarity index and providing rich visualizations.

   abstract = {Comparative genomics provides ample ways to study genome evolution and its relationship to phenotypic traits. By developing and testing alternate models of evolution throughout a phylogeny, one can estimate rates of molecular evolution along different lineages in a phylogeny and link these rates with observations in extant species, such as convergent phenotypes. Pipelines for such work can help identify when and where genomic changes may be associated with, or possibly influence, phenotypic traits. We recently developed a set of models called PhyloAcc, using a Bayesian framework to estimate rates of nucleotide substitution on different branches of a phylogenetic tree and evaluate their association with pre-defined or estimated phenotypic traits. PhyloAcc-ST and PhyloAcc-GT both allow users to define a priori a set of target lineages and then compare different models to identify loci accelerating in one or more target lineages. Whereas ST considers only one species tree across all input loci, GT considers alternate topologies for every locus. PhyloAcc-C simultaneously models molecular rates and rates of continuous trait evolution, allowing the user to ask whether the two are associated. Here, we describe these models and provide tips and workflows on how to prepare the input data and run PhyloAcc.},

   abstract = {Occurring independently at seven separate origins across the avian tree of life, obligate brood parasitism is a unique suite of traits observed in only approximately 1% of all bird species. Obligate brood parasites exhibit varied physiological, morphological, and behavioural traits across lineages, but common among all obligate brood parasites is that the females lay their eggs in the nest of other species. Unique among these species is the black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla), a generalist brood parasite that is the only obligate brood parasite among waterfowl. This provides an opportunity to assess evolutionary changes in traits associated with brood parasitism, notably the loss of parental care behaviours, with an unspecialized brood parasite. We generated new high-quality genome assemblies and genome annotations of the black-headed duck and three related non-parasitic species (freckled duck, African pygmy-goose, and ruddy duck). With these assemblies and existing public genome assemblies, we produced a whole genome alignment across Galloanserae to identify conserved non-coding regions with atypical accelerations in the black-headed duck and coding genes with evidence of positive selection, as well as to resolve uncertainties in the duck phylogeny. To complement these data, we sequenced a population sample of black-headed ducks, allowing us to conduct McDonald-Kreitman tests of lineage-specific selection. We resolve the existing polytomy between our focal taxa with concordance from coding and non-coding sequences, and we observe stronger signals of evolution in non-coding regions of the genome than in coding regions. Collectively, the new high-quality genomes, comparative genome alignment, and population genomics provide a detailed picture of genome evolution in the only brood parasitic duck.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {An important goal of evolutionary genomics is to identify genomic regions whose substitution rates differ among lineages. For example, genomic regions experiencing accelerated molecular evolution in some lineages may provide insight into links between genotype and phenotype. Several comparative genomics methods have been developed to identify genomic accelerations between species, including a Bayesian method called PhyloAcc, which models shifts in substitution rate in multiple target lineages on a phylogeny. However, few methods consider the possibility of discordance between the trees of individual loci and the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, which might cause false positives. Here, we present PhyloAcc-GT, which extends PhyloAcc by modeling gene tree heterogeneity. Given a species tree, we adopt the multispecies coalescent model as the prior distribution of gene trees, use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference, and design novel MCMC moves to sample gene trees efficiently. Through extensive simulations, we show that PhyloAcc-GT outperforms PhyloAcc and other methods in identifying target lineage-specific accelerations and detecting complex patterns of rate shifts, and is robust to specification of population size parameters. PhyloAcc-GT is usually more conservative than PhyloAcc in calling convergent rate shifts because it identifies more accelerations on ancestral than on terminal branches. We apply PhyloAcc-GT to two examples of convergent evolution: flightlessness in ratites and marine mammal adaptations, and show that PhyloAcc-GT is a robust tool to identify shifts in substitution rate associated with specific target lineages while accounting for incomplete lineage sorting.},
