Keyword,"A reserved word in a programming language that has a specific meaning and purpose. Keywords cannot be used as variable names.","`if`, `else`, `for`","`if`, `else`, `for`"
Conditional,"**Keywords** that allows for different actions to be taken based on whether a specific condition is met. Typically in the form of if-else statements using the `if`, `else if` (or type some similar way), and `else`.","`if`, `elif`, `else`","`if`, `else if`, `else`"
Logical expression,"An expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. Logical expressions are used in **conditional statements** to determine the flow of a program.","`5 > 3` returns `True`","`5 > 3` returns `TRUE`"
Loop,"**Keywords** that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Typically `while` and `for` loops are used. A `while` loop will continue to execute as long as a condition is met, and a `for` loop will execute a specific number of times.","`for`, `while`","`for`, `while`"
Loop variable,"A variable that acts as the counter or iterator in a loop, determining the number of iterations or elements accessed. Typically discussed for `for` loops, this is a variable that is used to control the number of times the loop is executed or to access elements in an iterable data structure. It is defined as the `for` loop is called.","In `for i in range(10):`, `i` is the loop variable","In `for (i in 1:10)`, `i` is the loop variable"
Block of code,"In general, this could refer to any lines of code one is referring to. However, by definition it is a section of code that is grouped together, often within curly braces `{}`. Blocks of code are often used to define the scope of variables or to group together related operations.","In Python, blocks are defined by indentation","In R, blocks are defined by curly braces `{}`"
Indentation,"The use of whitespace at the beginning of lines to define the structure of a program's code, which is syntactically significant in languages like Python.","**Code blocks** are defined using indentation.","Indentation improves readability but is not syntactically significant."
