"<a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>Github <span class=""icon-external""></span></a>","A web-based platform that facilitates **Git**'s use for collaboration between individuals. Other web-based platforms include <a href='https://about.gitlab.com/' target='_blank'>GitLab <span class=""icon-external""></span><a> and <a href='https://bitbucket.org/' target='_blank'>BitBucket <span class=""icon-external""></span></a>."
Repository/Repo,"A **directory** of files that has been initialized by Git for syncing, possibly including code, documentation, or data."
Remote repository,"A repository that is hosted on a server, typically on a web-based platform like Github."
`init`,The process of initializing a directory as a Git repository.
`clone`,A copy of a repository or the process of copying a repository. Typically used when downloading a repository from Github or one of the other web-based Git platforms.
Fork,"Creating a personal copy of a repository on your own account from an original repository, possibly from another account or organization, enabling modifications without affecting the original."
Branch,"A copy of a repository from a certain point within that repository's history. Typically a repository has a ""main"" branch and other branches are created off of it. Changes on the main branch are not reflected in the split branch unless explicitly synced and vice versa."
`pull`,"The process of integrating changes from one version of a repository to another (*e.g.* from a fork back to the original repo, or from a branch back to the main branch). There are two general use cases: 1) When the owner of a repository makes changes to it, you **pull** those changes into your local copy. 2) When you make changes to a forked repository or a branch of a repository and want to incorporate the changes back to the original repo or branch, you initiate a **pull request**, and then whoever is in charge of the original repository can **pull** those changes in."
Pull request,"When someone has made changes to a fork or a branch that they wish the owner's or the original repository to incorporate, they initiate a **pull request** so the owner can review and potentially **pull** the changes."
`merge`,"The process of combining changes from one branch into another branch, typically done as part of a **pull request**."
Conflict,"A situation where two branches have changes in a file that Git cannot automatically merge, requiring manual resolution."
Staging area,"When a user changes or adds files to a repository, they must first add them to an intermediate **staging area** where they can be reviewed."
`add`,The process of adding new/edited files to the staging area.
`commit`,The process of saving changes to the repository. This is done after adding files to the staging area.
`push`,The process of uploading committed changes from a local repository to a remote repository to a remote platform (*e.g.* Github).
`status`,"A command that shows the status of the repository, including which files have been changed, added, or deleted."
`switch`/`checkout`,A command that allows you to switch between branches.
.gitignore,A file that tells Git which files to ignore when committing changes.
