Programming language,"A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. These languages are used to create software, scripts, and other sets of instructions for computers. Programming languages can be broadly categorized as compiled or interpreted based on how their instructions are executed.","Python is an intepreted language","R is an interpreted language"

Operator,"In programming, operators are special functions that are **denoted by specific symbols or keywords** and can be used to manipulate and compare information in the program. Sometimes the way an operator works depends on the **data type** being used with it. Some examples of operators are `+` to add two numbers in many languages, `in` to check inclusion in Python.","`+` for addition of numbers, `+` for concatenation of strings, `in` for inclusion in a list","`+` for addition of numbers, `==` for equality"

Arithmetic operators,"Many programming language have basic arithmetic operators to manipulate numeric data types, like `+` for **addition**, `-` for **subtraction**, `*` for **multiplication**, and `/` for **division**. Note that in some programming languages, these symbols can be used as operators for other data types with different outcomes, for example in Python, the `+` operator can also concatenate (combine) two strings together.","`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`","`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`"

Negation operator,"For any comparison or logical operation, a **negation** can be made, represented in many programming languages as `!` or `not`, e.g. `!TRUE` is equivalent to `FALSE`.","`!`, `not`","`!`"
Block of code,"In general, this could refer to any lines of code one is referring to. However, by definition it is a section of code that is grouped together, often within curly braces `{}`. Blocks of code are often used to define the scope of variables or to group together related operations.","In Python, blocks are defined by indentation","In R, blocks are defined by curly braces `{}`"
Indentation,"The use of whitespace at the beginning of lines to define the structure of a program's code, which is syntactically significant in languages like Python.","**Code blocks** are defined using indentation.","Indentation improves readability but is not syntactically significant."
Comment,"A piece of text in a program that is not executed when the program is run but is used to convey information to the human reading the code. Comments are often used to explain the purpose of the code, how it works, or to leave notes for future developers.","In Python, comments are denoted by `#`","In R, comments are denoted by `#`"
Literal,"A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. For example, `5` is a literal for the integer 5, and `'hello'` is a literal for the string 'hello'.","`5` is a literal for the integer 5","`5` is a literal for the integer 5"
Error,"An error is a mistake in the code that causes the program to stop executing. Errors can be caused by syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors.","A `SyntaxError` occurs when the code is not written in the expected format","A `SyntaxError` occurs when the code is not written in the expected format"
Syntax error,"An error that occurs when the code is not written in the expected format of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the interpreter or compiler before the program is executed.","For example, missing a colon at the end of an `if` statement in Python","For example, missing a comma in a function call with multipl arguments in R"
Logical error,"An error that occurs when the code does not produce the expected output due to a mistake in the logic of the program. Logical errors are often difficult to detect because the program will still run, but the output will be incorrect.","Using the `+` operator instead of the `-` operator in a subtraction operation","Using the `+` operator instead of the `-` operator in a subtraction operation"
Runtime error,"An error that occurs when the program is running. Runtime errors can be caused by a variety of issues, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an index that does not exist, or running out of memory.","A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when dividing by zero in Python","A `data.frame` not found error in R"
Exception,"An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, an exception is raised. In many programming languages, exceptions can be handled, allowing the program to continue running.","A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when dividing by zero in Python","A `data.frame` not found error in R"
Exception handling,"The process of dealing with exceptions in a program. By using **try** and **except** blocks, a program can catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.","In Python, `try:` and `except:` blocks are used for exception handling","In R, `tryCatch()` is used for exception handling"
