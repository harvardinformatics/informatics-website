Term,Definition,Python example,R example
Error,"An error is a mistake in code that causes the program to stop executing. Errors can be **syntax errors**, **logical errors**, or **runtime errors**.","A `SyntaxError` occurs when the code is not written in the expected format","A `SyntaxError` occurs when the code is not written in the expected format"
Syntax error,"An error that occurs when the code is not written in the expected format of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the interpreter or compiler before the program is executed.","For example, missing a colon at the end of an `if` statement in Python","For example, missing a comma in a function call with multipl arguments in R"
Logical error,"An error that occurs when the code does not produce the expected output due to a mistake in the logic of the program. Logical errors are often difficult to detect because the program will still run, but the output will be incorrect.","Using the `+` operator instead of the `-` operator in a subtraction operation","Using the `+` operator instead of the `-` operator in a subtraction operation"
Runtime error,"An error that occurs when the program is running. Runtime errors can be caused by a variety of issues, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an index that does not exist, or running out of memory.","A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when dividing by zero in Python","A `data.frame` not found error in R"
Exception,"An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, an exception is raised. In many programming languages, exceptions can be handled, allowing the program to continue running.","A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when dividing by zero in Python","A `data.frame` not found error in R"
Exception handling,"The process of dealing with exceptions in a program. By using **try** and **except** blocks, a program can catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.","In Python, `try:` and `except:` blocks are used for exception handling","In R, `tryCatch()` is used for exception handling"
