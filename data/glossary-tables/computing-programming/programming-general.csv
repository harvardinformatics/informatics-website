Term,Definition,Python example,R example
Programming language,"A programming language is a consistent set of rules for how instructions should be typed so the computer understands them and can execute them logically. These rules are used to create software. Programming languages can be broadly categorized as compiled or interpreted based on how their instructions are executed.","Python is an intepreted language","R is an interpreted language"
Compiled language,"A programming language that is translated into machine code (**compiled**) before the program is run. This machine code is specific to the type of computer the program will run on. Examples: C, C++, Java ","*NA*","*NA*"
Interpreted language,"A programming language that is executed line by line by another program called an **interpreter**. The interpreter reads the code and executes it directly. Examples: Perl, JavaScript, R","Python is an interpreted language","R is an interpreted language"
Syntax,"The way a particular programming language expects its code to be typed, following the rules defined by that language.","*NA*","*NA*"
Comment,"A piece of text in a program that is not executed when the program is run but is used to convey information to the human reading the code. Comments are often used to explain the purpose of the code, how it works, or to leave notes for future developers.","In Python, comments are denoted by `#`","In R, comments are denoted by `#`"
Object-oriented programming (OOP)*,"A programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data, in the form of **attributes**, and code, in the form of **methods**. OOP focuses on reusability and modularity in programming.","Python is an object-oriented language, enabling the creation of **classes**","R, while primarily a functional programming language, supports OOP"
Functional programming,"A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.","Python supports functional programming features","R is a functional programming language"
