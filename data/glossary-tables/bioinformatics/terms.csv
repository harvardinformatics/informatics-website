Term,Definition
Sequence libraries,A sample of DNA that has been processed to be sequenced.
Reads,Fragmented and overlapping pieces of a DNA strand that are sequenced.
Phred quality scores,"A scaled probability that a given inference (usually a called base) is incorrect. The probabilty of error, P(e), scaled by -10 log P(e)."
Short reads,"Reads from first and second generation sequencing such as Sanger, Illumina, IonTorrent, etc. Short reads can range from 30-1000bp long."
Read pair,"Many short read sequencing technologies sequence from both ends of a DNA fragment, resulting in a pair of sequenced reads that come from said fragment."
Adapter,A short piece of DNA that is ligated to the short fragment to be sequenced. The adapter allows the fragment to be affixed to a physical medium (such as a flow cell) to facilitate amplification and sequencing.
Insert size,The size of the DNA fragment between the adapter sequences.
Mate pairs,Long-insert paired end reads prepared by circularizing longer DNA fragments.
Jumping libraries,Junction-fragment libraries. Mate pair libraries.
Long reads,Reads from single-molecule sequencing technology such as PacBio SMRT and Oxford Nanopore. Long reads can range from 1000-100000+bp long.
"""Genome assembly, Assembly, de novo Assembly""","""1. The process by which small overlapping parts of the genome are reconstructed into longer contiguous sequences, 2. A sequence that has undergone the assembly process."""
Contigs,Assembled reads. Contig assembly is usually done with a graph-based representation (i.e. de Bruijn graphs) of overlapping sequence reads.
Scaffolds,Contigs that have been joined together to form longer sequences. Scaffolding is usually done using read pair information or long reads.
Reference genome,An already assembled genome to which you can compare newly sequenced reads or genomes.
Read mapping,The process of aligning reads from a newly sequenced genome to a reference genome
Mapping quality,A usually Phred scaled probability that a given read has mapped incorrectly.
Reference-guided assembly,"""1. The process of using read mapping to reconstruct the genome from a set of reads, 2. A sequence that has undergone the reference-guided assembly process."""
Reference bias,The phenomenon of a set of mapped reads appearing to resembe (through lower divergence) the reference genome more closely than they actually do because reads containing the most variation were not mapped.
Iterative mapping,"The process of mapping reads to a reference genome, generating a reference-guided assembly, and then repeating the process this time mapping to the new reference guided assembly. Done to reduce reference bias."
