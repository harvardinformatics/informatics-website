Term,Definition
R,"A functional programming language with an emphasis on statistical analysis and data visualization."
Rstudio,"An **IDE** built around the R programming language."
Environment,"The set of scripts, packages, and data currently loaded into memory in RStudio."
Console,"An interactive command line in RStudio that accepts one R command at a time to be executed when the ENTER key is pressed."
Function,"A block of code that can be called by name to perform a specific task. Functions can take **arguments** and **return** values. In R, functions are called by typing the function name followed by parentheses which includes any passed arguments, *e.g.* `mean(x)` takes a vector of numbers (here represented by `x` and returns the algebraic average."
Argument,"A value passed to a function when it is called."
Return value,"The value that a function gives back after it is called."
Package,"A collection of functions available to be installed to perform specific tasks."
Markdown,"A syntax for formatting plain text and interleaving code blocks that can be run when the document is generated."
Code block,"In a markdown document, separate blocks of text that are interpreted as code when the document is generated."
`<-`,"An **assignment operator** in R that can be used to assign values to operators, e.g. `x <- 10` assigns the variable x the **numeric** value of 10. **Note that R also allows use of the equals sign `=` for assignment.**"
Object,"Data of any type that has been stored as a variable in the current environment."
Character,"A data type that stores text, *e.g.* `my_char <- 'Hello, World!'` defines a character object."
Numeric,"A data type of numbers that can be integers or decimals. While R has a specific data type for integers, numerics are the default way numbers are represented can be used for both integers and decimals."
Boolean,"A data type with two possible values, in R these are typed as `TRUE` or `FALSE` or in their abbreviated form as `T` or `F`."
Conditional statement,"A statement that evaluates whether a condition is met and then executes a block of code if it is. In R, the syntax is `else if (condition) {code block}`, which can be followed by else `if (condition) {code block}` and/or `else {code block}`. Note the parentheses around the condition are required, and the curly brackets are necessary to define the code block."
Loop,"In R, a structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. The two main types of loops are `for` and `while`."
Vector,"A data structure that contains multiple objects stored as a collection, *e.g.* `my_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5)` defines a vector of numerics."
Data frame,"A data structure that is a collection of vectors stored as a table with rows and columns, with the columns being the vector names."
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">tidyverse</a>,"The tidyverse is a collection of R **packages** designed for data science, offering tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, all adhering to a consistent grammar and intuitive **syntax** that emphasizes readability and ease of use."
Tibble,"A data structure that is the **tidyverse** implementation of a data frame."
List,"A data structure made up of a collection of any type of objects."
