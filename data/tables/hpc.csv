Term,Definition
Server,"A general term for a computer that allows others to connect to it via a network. In HPC, this is a computer setup to have users connect and work on it remotely, usually with more resources than personal computers to accommodate more resource intensive commands and multiple users."
ssh,"A program that allows users to connect to a server remotely, possibly by typing `ssh <username>@<server address>` into a **terminal**, though there are many ways to connect to a server."
Cluster,"An interconnected collection of **servers** setup such that users can connect to one and specify high resource commands to run which are distributed to the others based on available resources."
Node,"One computer within a cluster."
Login node,"The **node** within the **cluster** which users connect to and interact with. Users can submit jobs from the login node, but they are not run there."
Head node,"The **node** within the **cluster** which handles job scheduling and resource allocation, though sometimes login nodes are used as head nodes."
Compute node,"The **node** within the **cluster** which actually runs the jobs."
Job,"A submitted **command** or set of commands passed from the user to the job scheduler on a **cluster**."
Job scheduler,"A program that coordinates job submission for all users on the cluster. This program distributes jobs to compute nodes and allocates resources. Harvard uses the <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/ target="_blank">SLURM</a> job scheduling program."
Queue,"A list of jobs waiting to be run on a **cluster**."
Partition,"A subset of the **cluster**'s resources that can be allocated to a job. Partitions can have different resource limits and priorities."
Interactive job,"A job that is run on a **cluster** in real time, allowing the user to interact with the job as it runs. On SLURM, this involves using `salloc` to allocate resources and `srun` to execute applications interactively within the allocated environment."
Batch job,"A job that is submitted to a **cluster** and run without user interaction. On SLURM, this is done with the `sbatch` command."
