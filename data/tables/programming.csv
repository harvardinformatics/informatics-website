Term,Definition
Text editor,"A graphical program on a computer that displays plain text files on the screen and allows them to be edited. Many text editors designed for coding (*e.g.* <a href=""https://code.visualstudio.com/"" target=""_blank"">VSCode</a>) have features like syntax highlighting, code folding, and automatic indentation."
Integrated Development Environment (IDE),"A graphical program on a computer that contains tools to aid development in a specific programming language (*e.g.* RStudio for R)."
Syntax,"The way a particular programming language expects its code to be written."
Variable,"The name of a piece of information stored into memory in a computer program. This name can be referred to later in the program and be used to manipulate the information."
Data type,"The way data is encoded on the computer. Different operations can be performed on different data types. Some examples of data types are **integers** in Python, **numeric** in R, and **character** in many languages."
Boolean,"A universal data type that can only have one of two values, usually `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Booleans are often used in programming to make and evaluate complex logical statements."
Data structure,"The way data is organized within a programming language. Different operations can be performed on different data structures. Some examples of data structures are **lists** in Python, **data frames** in R, and **arrays** in many languages."
Function,"A generalized chunk of code that can be easily be called (run) by other code."
Argument,"A value passed to a function or program when it is called."
Parameter,"A variable that is used in a function to represent an argument that is passed to it."
Return value,"The value that a function or program gives back after it is called."
Operator,"In programming, operators are special functions that are **denoted by specific symbols or keywords** and can be used to manipulate and compare information in the program. Sometimes the way an operator works depends on the **data type** being used with it. Some examples of operators are `+` to add two numbers in many languages, `in` to check inclusion in Python."
Assignment operator,"In many programming language, a *variable* can be **assigned** a value with the equals sign (`=`); *e.g.* `var_name = 1` assigns a variable named `var_name` the value of the integer `1`."
Arithmetic operators,"Many programming language have basic arithmetic operators to manipulate numeric data types, like `+` for **addition**, `-` for **subtraction**, `*` for **multiplication**, and `/` for **division**. Note that in some programming languages, these symbols can be used as operators for other data types with different outcomes, for example in Python, the `+` operator can also concatenate (combine) two strings together."
Logical operators,Logical operators allow comparisons of CONDITIONS. Common logical operators are **and** (represented as `&&` or `&` or `and`) and **or** (represented as **||** or **|** or `or`). 
Comparative operators,"Logical comparisons of numbers include **equality** (`==`), **greater than** (`>`), **greater than or equal to** (`>=`), **less than** (`<`), **less than or equal to** (`<=`). These return a boolean TRUE or FALSE value."
Inclusion operators,"Some languages use another operator to check whether a certain value is included within a larger data structure, sometimes denoted as `in`. These operators return a boolean TRUE or FALSE value."
Negation operator,"For any comparison or logical operation, a **negation** can be made, represented in many programming languages as `!` or `not`, e.g. `!TRUE` is equivalent to `FALSE`."
Conditional,"A programming structure that allows for different actions to be taken based on whether a specific condition is met. Typically in the form of if-else statements using the `if`, `else if` (or type some similar way), and `else`."
Loop,"A programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Typically `while` and `for` loops are used. A `while` loop will continue to execute as long as a condition is met, and a `for` loop will execute a specific number of times."
