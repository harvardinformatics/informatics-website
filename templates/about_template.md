## About us

The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Informatics Group (FAS Informatics) is a small group of scientists and software developers working to advance research and teaching by facilitiating computational analysis of scientific data, primarily in biology. We work closely with data-generating scientific cores and with students, postdocs, and faculty generating data to help make research and discovery efficient and productive. 

The mission of the Bioinformatics Core includes training, consulting, and research. We run workshops on a variety of subjects of interest to researchers at Harvard and beyond, focusing on introductory and intermediate topics designed to introduce scientists to tools and techniques for the computational analysis of biological big data. We provide one-on-one advice to individuals or lab groups who need assistance with figuring out bioinformatics approaches or debugging computational methods. We conduct research, both grant-funded and as part of collaborations with labs on campus, with a general focus on method development and best practices investigations to meet the needs of the research community.

Prior to 2025, the group also included the Software Operations Core. Their mission is to support the needs of data generation core facilities by developing software infrastructure. This includes everything from data processing pipelines, to instrument scheduling and training, to billing and invoicing.

As of February 2025, Software Operations has moved to [Research Computing](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/)!
